CAPTAIN AMERICA
The actual name of Captain America is Steve Rogers.He is a normal civilian of New York city.He doesn't have any family and parents.His best friend is Bucky Barnes.His dream is to join in Army during world war time and fight against germans.But he doesn't have suitable physical and health conditions to join in army.Fortunately he was selected for the test of serum made by howard stark which made him winter soldier and successfully worked on him with out any side affects.But Red skull also used the same serum before him and faced severe consequences.He is the head of scientific research and weapons of germany.

After he woke up from the ice he worked under nick fury and S.H.I.E.L.D(Strategic Homeland Intervention,Enforcement and Logistics Division).Later he joined in Avengers,a team of earth's mightiest heroes,and became leader of this team and protected earth from threats.

Captain America has outstanding leadership qualities among all the other avengers.He believes his principles strongly and didn't listen even the avengers if they are wrong.This strong behaviour of Captain America led to the Civil War between two groups of avengers.One group believes that working under government is good for both avengers and people of earth.But the group led by captain america wants to work independently because they think that their decision making,efficiency of protection and freedom will be affected badly.Due to some incidents later avengers will be divided.During this time supervillian Thanos came into action.They lost to him due to lack of unity(I believe with out proper plan).But later they managed to win it against thanos with some unusual technology.
